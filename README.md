Android Gesture Detectors Example
=================================

Introduction
------------

This is an example of the [Android Gesture Detectors Framework (GitHub)](https://github.com/Almeros/android-gesture-detectors). 
You can read more about it [on my blog](http://code.almeros.com/android-multitouch-gesture-detectors).

This example uses the Android Gesture Detectors Framework to show the earth. You can rotate, pinch, 
shove and move our precious earth with your fingertips. Remember, with power comes responsibility! ;)

Check out the TouchActivity.java for all the magic.

This example uses a dependency on the project through Jitpack.io. See the different build.gradle files 
for how this is configured. This example is currently set to use v1.0 of the framework.
